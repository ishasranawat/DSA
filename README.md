# DSA
A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations and problems for interview preparation.





My DSA Journey ðŸš€
This repository is my personal space to track, practice, and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is a step-by-step log of my progress, problem-solving approaches, and learning journey in the world of algorithms and programming.

ðŸ“Œ Purpose
To document my DSA learning progress.
To organize problems Iâ€™ve solved and concepts Iâ€™ve mastered.
To serve as a quick reference for concepts and solutions during future revisions.

ðŸŒ± My Learning Plan
Hereâ€™s the roadmap Iâ€™m following to strengthen my DSA skills:

Arrays and Strings: Basics, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques.
Linked Lists: Singly, doubly, and circular lists.
Stacks and Queues: Applications and implementations.
Trees and Graphs: Traversals, shortest paths, and spanning trees.
Dynamic Programming: Subproblems, tabulation, and memoization.
Recursion: Fundamental problem-solving and advanced problems.
Sorting and Searching: Optimized sorting algorithms and search techniques.



This README will evolve as I make progress in my journey.
